## Requirements

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Version 16 or higher
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional)

## Getting started

First, make sure you have all the required tools installed on your local machine then continue with these steps.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TannerGabriel/discord-bot.git

# Enter into the directory
cd discord-bot/

# Install the dependencies
npm install

# Configure Discord Bot Token
 echo "DISCORD_TOKEN='INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'" > .env
```

### Required permissions

Make sure that your bot has the `applications.commands` application scope enabled, which can be found under the `OAuth2` tab on the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/)

Enable the `Server Members Intent` and `Message Content Intent` which can be found under the `Bot` tab on the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/)

### Configuration

After cloning the project and installing all dependencies, you need to add your Discord API token in the `.env` file.

### Changing the status

You can change the status of your discord bot by editing the `activity` and `activityType` variables inside the `config.json` file. `activityType` needs to be set to an integer with the following [options](https://discord-api-types.dev/api/discord-api-types-v10/enum/ActivityType).


### Starting the application

```bash
node index.js
```

### Starting the application using Docker

```bash
# Build the image
docker build --tag discordbot .

# Run the image
docker run -d discordbot
```

### Deploying commands

Before you can use the bots slash command you first need to add them to your Discord server. You can use the `!deploy` command to do so.

After deploying the commands you should be able to see and access them by typing a slash:

## Docker

A mutliarch docker image for `amd64` and `arm64` based on the main branch is available from Github Container Registry:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/TannerGabriel/discord-bot:latest
```

A Github Action automatically builds and push `amd64` and `arm64` to ghcr.io, all builds are based on the main branch.

Only `:latest` tag is supported, otherwise use SHA256 from https://github.com/TannerGabriel/discord-bot/pkgs/container/discord-bot for pinning to a specific commit.

## Common errors

Here is a list of common errors and how you can fix them.

### Dependencies aren't up to date

The packages used in this repository get updated often, especially the ytdl-core package. That is why it is always worth a try updating those if you get an error like `invalid URL: undefined` or when the bot crashes when running the play command.

```bash
npm install ytdl-core@latest
```

### FFMPEG is not installed on the machine running the bot

The `play` command requires FFMPEG to be installed on the machine that is running the bot. You can download it on the official [FFMPEG website](https://www.ffmpeg.org/). Note: This isn't relevant if you use the Dockerfile because it will install FFMPEG inside of the container.
